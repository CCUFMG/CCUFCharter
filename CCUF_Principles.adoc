== CCUF Principles
=== Mission
The Common Criteria Usersâ€™ Forum mission is to provide a voice and communications channel between the CC community and the Common Criteria organizational committees, CCRA member organizations (national schemes), and policy makers. In order to further the CCUF mission, our objectives are to improve and promote Common Criteria by seeking to

* Support and foster the goal of worldwide mutual recognition.
* Promote focused international Technical Communities and technical working groups, to enable the creation of useful, realistic, internationally-recognized protection profiles, supporting documents, and advance Common Criteria.
* Help to assure customers of evaluated products with meaningful evaluation results.
* Encourage viable policies and processes for maintaining certification through product updates.
* Encourage viable policies and processes for certifying systems that are composed of certified parts.
* Minimize the time, effort, and cost required to complete evaluations which lead to appropriate levels of assurance.
