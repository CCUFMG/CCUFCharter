== Introduction
This document provides a general set of definitions for terms used in the Common Critiera Users Forum governing documents.

== Definitions
(Voting) Entity::
When determining eligibility in counting votes, an organization counts as a single voting entity, even if multiple employees of that organization are members of the CCUF. The entity is defined as all related portions of the organization under a single umbrella, so subdivisions, even in separate countries, as still counted as the same entity. An individual registered without an organization is counted as an entity.

== Voting Change Requirements
Changing this document requires approval by a majority in a vote as defined in the CCUF Voting Procedures.
